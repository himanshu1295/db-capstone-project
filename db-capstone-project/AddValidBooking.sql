-- Task 3
-- Little Lemon need to verify a booking, and decline any reservations for tables that are already booked under another name. 

-- Since integrity is not optional, Little Lemon need to ensure that every booking attempt includes these verification and decline steps. 
-- However, implementing these steps requires a stored procedure and a transaction. 

-- To implement these steps, you need to create a new procedure called AddValidBooking. 
-- This procedure must use a transaction statement to perform a rollback if a customer reserves a table thatâ€™s already booked under another name.  

-- Use the following guidelines to complete this task:
-- The procedure should include two input parameters in the form of booking date and table number.
-- It also requires at least one variable and should begin with a START TRANSACTION statement.
-- Your INSERT statement must add a new booking record using the input parameter's values.
-- Use an IF ELSE statement to check if a table is already booked on the given date. 
-- If the table is already booked, then rollback the transaction. If the table is available, then commit the transaction.
