-- Task 2
-- In the second task, Little Lemon need you to help them to create a prepared statement called GetOrderDetail. 
-- This prepared statement will help to reduce the parsing time of queries. 
-- It will also help to secure the database from SQL injections.

-- The prepared statement should accept one input argument, the OrderID value, from a variable. 
-- The statement should return the order id, the quantity and the order cost from the Orders table.â€¯
-- Once you create the prepared statement, you can create a variable called id and assign it value of 1. 
-- Then execute the GetOrderDetail prepared statement.

PREPARE GetOrderDetail FROM '
SELECT OrderID, Quantity, TotalCost
FROM Orders
WHERE OrderID = ?
'

SET @id = 1;
EXECUTE GetOrderDetail USING @id;
