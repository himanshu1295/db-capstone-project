-- Task 1
-- In the first task, Little Lemon need you to create a virtual table called OrdersView 
-- that focuses on OrderID, Quantity and Cost columns within the Orders table for all orders with a quantity greater than 2. 
-- Here’s some guidance around completing this task: 
-- Use a CREATE VIEW statement.
-- Extract the order id, quantity and cost data from the Orders table.
-- Filter data from the orders table based on orders with a quantity greater than 2. 


CREATE VIEW OrdersView AS 
SELECT OrderID, Quantity, TotalCost
FROM Orders 
WHERE Quantity > 2;

SELECT * FROM OrdersView;
